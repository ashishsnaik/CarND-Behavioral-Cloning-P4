## Overview
---
In this project, my goal is to develop a ConvNet model in Keras to predict the steering angle of a vehicle, based on the position of the vehicle on the road. The project uses image data and steering angles, generated using a Udacity provided simulator, to train a convolutional neural network, and uses this model to predict a steering angle in order to drive the car autonomously around a track.

## The Project
---
**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior 
* Design, train and validate a model that predicts a steering angle from image data
* Use the model to drive the vehicle autonomously around the first track in the simulator. The vehicle should remain on the road for an entire loop around the track.
* Summarize the results with a written report
